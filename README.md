# Methods of Advanced Data Engineering (MADE SS24) - Felix Lang

This repository contains the project work and exercises for the course "MADE" in the summer semester 2024 at the FAU.

## Project Work
In my project I want to evaluate the effectiveness of carbon pricing in greenhouse gas emission reduction. I will use the World Bank's Carbon Pricing Dashboard and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research as data sources. 
For more information see my [project plan](project/project-plan.md).

## Exercises

The exercise submitions are placed in the `exercises` folder. Each exercise submission is named `excercise<number>.jy`. The exercise submitions are checked by the automated tests. The results of the tests can be seen in the badges above.
