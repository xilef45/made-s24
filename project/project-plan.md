# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Evaluation of the effectiveness of carbon pricing in greenhouse gas emission reduction

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How effective are carbon pricing policies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In many countries, carbon pricing is a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by putting a cost on carbon dioxide emissions. The aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. This project aims to analyse open data on carbon pricing and greenhouse gas emissions to understand the effectiveness of carbon pricing policies. Different data sources will be used to analyse the impact of carbon pricing on greenhouse gas emissions in different countries. The results of this project may provide insights into the effectiveness of carbon pricing as a climate change mitigation strategy. 


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
